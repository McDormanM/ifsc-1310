	<p>I include Logistics & Inventory Management on my resume to showcase my ability to oversee complex supply chain operations, 
	maintain accurate stock levels, and ensure efficient procurement and distribution of materials. These skills demonstrate my
	 capacity to support operational readiness and cost-efficiency—essential in both corporate and government environments.
	 My experience includes using modern inventory systems to streamline processes, reduce waste, and ensure accurate reporting.</p>

	 <p>Leadership & Team Supervision reflects my proven track record in guiding teams toward shared objectives, enhancing productivity,
	and fostering a collaborative work environment. I list this to illustrate my ability to manage personnel effectively,
	resolve conflicts, and maintain high team morale. In connection with this, Customer Service & Communication is listed
	to emphasize my strength in building client relationships, handling inquiries and complaints professionally, and serving
	as a liaison between departments—critical traits in any customer-facing or cross-functional role.</p>
	
	<p>GCSS (Global Combat Support System) is highlighted to demonstrate my familiarity with Department of Defense logistics platforms,
	 which is especially valuable for defense-related roles that require experience in asset tracking, requisition, and supply
	chain management. My understanding of HTML & CSS is included to show that I have the foundational web skills needed to support
	internal systems, edit intranet content, or collaborate with technical teams on digital platforms. I also list my Security Clearance
	to convey that I'm qualified to handle sensitive or classified information—something vital for federal or defense-related positions.
	Lastly, OSHA Certification is presented to signal my commitment to workplace safety and compliance, which is essential for roles in
	industrial, logistics, or facilities management environments.</p>
